# WDSC â€” Neural Network and Computer Vision Workshop

## Summary

The workshop goes over the math and individual components used to create neural networks. I go over two basic applications: building a feedforward neural network from scratch and classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset (computer vision). At the end of the workshop, I touch on how to create convolutional neural networks (CNN's), which are the most commonly used neural network architecture for computer vision. As one of WDSC's VPs of Education, this was the workshop that I hosted.

## Presentation

For the workshop, I create a slideshow that went over terms and concepts used in neural networks. You can look at the slideshow here[https://bit.ly/2U0U8Jr].

## Notebook

I created a notebook to demonstrate two applications of neural networks: a feedforward neural network made from scratch and an ANN made with TensorFlow for classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset (computer vision). You can see the notebook here[https://bit.ly/32pKlRJ] or click on the notebook file in this repository.

## YouTube

The workshop was recorded and uploaded to YouTube! You can watch the video here[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_YsKhBooOc&ab_channel=UWaterlooDataScience].
